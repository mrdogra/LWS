    One of the early wave of blogging pioneers, web designer Jason Kottke started keeping track of interesting things on
    the internet as far back as 1998. The site took off, boosted partly through close links to popular blog-building website
    Blogger (he later married one of the founders). And as the phenomenon grew quickly, Kottke became a well-known filter
    for surfers on the lookout for interesting reading.

    Kottke remains one of the purest old-skool bloggers on the block - it's a selection of links to websites and articles
    rather than a repository for detailed personal opinion - and although it remains fairly esoteric, his favourite topics
    include film, science, graphic design and sport. He often picks up trends and happenings before friends start forwarding
    them to your inbox. Kottke's decision to consciously avoid politics could be part of his appeal (he declares himself 'not a fan'),
    particularly since the blog's voice is literate, sober and inquiring, unlike much of the red-faced ranting found elsewhere online.

    A couple of key moments boosted Kottke's fame: first, being threatened with legal action by Sony for breaking news about a TV show,
    but most notably quitting his web-design job and going solo three years ago. A host of 'micropatrons' and readers donated cash to
    cover his salary, but these days he gets enough advertising to pay the bills. He continues to plug away at the site as it enters
    its 10th year.
