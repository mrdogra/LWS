<p>
    I’ve never met Erin before in person, but goodness, I feel like she is such a kindred spirit.  And I have completely
    enjoyed tuning into her blog for years (like, so many years now!) for a dose of real-life inspiration and lovely prose.
    Her posts on navigating motherhood (with her sweet little toddler) and marriage have always been some of my favorites.
    But I have always especially connected with her posts on work, and creativity, and self-care, probably because they’re
    always words I need to take to heart myself.  I also really admire how brave and open she has been to letting her career
    evolve/change in some big ways over the past decade, and I can’t wait to follow along wherever the next roads may lead.
