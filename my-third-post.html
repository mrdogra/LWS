<p>
    In a quiet room, we can find stillness. And in that stillness, we can contemplate our own mind.
    What we often find is that the mind is very restless. It wants to take care of a thousand things,
    because it’s feeling some uncertainty and fear. It wants to fix problems, take care of all the undone things,
    figure out if everything is going to be OK. It wants to get all of our needs met,
    from survival needs to meaning, connection and love.
    The mind is restless, wanting to fix everything, get everything it needs.
