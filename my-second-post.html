    Lego reconstructions of pop videos and cakes baked in the shape of iPods are not generally considered relevant to serious
    political debate. But even the most earnest bloggers will often take time out of their busy schedule to pass on some titbit
    of mildly entertaining geek ephemera. No one has done more to promote pointless, yet strangely cool, time-wasting stuff
    on the net than the editors of Boing Boing (subtitle: A Directory of Wonderful Things). It launched in January 2000
    and has had an immeasurable influence on the style and idiom of blogging. But hidden among the pictures of steam-powered
    CD players and Darth Vader tea towels there is a steely, ultra-liberal political agenda: championing the web as a global
    medium free of state and corporate control.

    Boing Boing chronicles cases where despotic regimes have silenced or imprisoned bloggers. It helped channel blogger scorn
    on to Yahoo and Google when they kowtowed to China's censors in order to win investment opportunities. It was instrumental
    in exposing the creeping erosion of civil liberties in the US under post-9/11 'Homeland Security' legislation. And it routinely
    ridicules attempts by the music and film industries to persecute small-time file sharers and bedroom pirates instead of
    getting their own web strategies in order. It does it all with gentle, irreverent charm, polluted only occasionally
    with gratuitous smut.
